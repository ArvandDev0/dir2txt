### Example

```bash
python3 dir2txt.py . myproject.txt -i /.venv/ -d "Hi GPT. What is the problem with my code?"
```

Sample Output:

```text
Project structure
. Files that were selected:
|
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ utils/
    â””â”€â”€ helper.py

2 directories, 3 files

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- Merge all project files into one text file.

- Generate a tree view of the project structure (with directory & file counts).

- Ignore unwanted files or directories (`.git`, `__pycache__`, `.venv`, etc.).

- Add a custom project description at the end of the output.

- Supports reading from compressed archives (`.zip`, `.tar`, `.gz`, `.bz2`, `.xz`).

- Handles large files by skipping, truncating, or limiting the number of lines (configurable).

- Output format is designed to be clean, Markdown-friendly, and AI-readable.

- Pure Python, no external dependencies (standard library only).

## âœ… Why is this useful for LLMs?  
- LLMs perform best when the **entire codebase is in one file**.  
- The **tree view** helps AI understand the **project structure**.  
- Large/binary files are automatically summarized â†’ avoids token overload.  
- Markdown formatting ensures the output is **clean and structured** for AI parsing.  
- Works great for **AI code review, debugging, documentation, or refactoring**.
